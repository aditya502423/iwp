# Installation Work Pack Dashboard

Problem Statement
In big construction projects, tracking progress manually leads to delays, missed deadlines, and poor communication. This dashboard helps teams monitor tasks (IWPs), track delays, and compare planned vs actual progress â€” all in one place.

Solution after the dashboard is developed
The Power BI dashboard shows how many tasks are done vs pending, how much work is completed overall, which tasks are delayed, and compares the plan with real progress. This helps managers take quick action and avoid project delays.

Dashboard features 
Total IWP with split between Open and Closed
Planned vs Actual Execution (month-wise visual)
Delay Tracking with delay counts and days
% Closeout and % Work Completion
Open and Closed IWPs per Project
Filters by Contractor, Location, and Date

Tools Used
- Power BI
- DAX for calculated fields (e.g., % complete, delay categories)
